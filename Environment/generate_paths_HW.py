"""
The Goal of this File is to generate a bunch of sample paths for the value of our tracked market through 30 years

I'm setting the preliminary goal of around 1600 paths per hour since this gives us a reasonably fast
rate (We can get a testable set in about an hour, and a set that should be large enough to be useable over 
a day 24*1600 = 38400 paths)s

The 10 year HullWhite model takes ~30s per single core run, so we can get around 500 runs per hour.
----------- What are we finding and saving -----------
We need to at all times know the value of our hedging instruments, these will be (as I understand it)
r_t,
Q(T_i > tau)_t           for i in 1 to 30
Alternatively 
Swaption(T_i,T_end)_t    for i in 1 to 30
Q(T_i > tau)_t           for i in 1 to 30
Alternatively 
Swap(T_i, T_end)_t
Q(T_i > tau)_t           for i in 1 to 30

We also need the value of the CVA at every timepoint 
CVA_t

And we might as well include the default intensity since we know it, so it's only taking up whatever the write
/ read time is for one parameter, and we might want to hedge in it idk.


----------- How are we Saving it -----------
While grasping the data a dataframe is a natural choice, alternatively as in the demos a numpy matrix,
to save it, preliminarily CSV feels like a natural choice but I need to think about it. Pickle is also a choice


----------- How can we get speedups -----------
The first and most important speedup in my eyes is that we can pre-calculate certain elements that remain unchanged
across runs. For instance rstar(t), A(t,T) and B(t,T) are all unchanged no matter when or where they are evaluated. 
Some of these are acsessed literally thousands of times per run, and over thousands of runs that means millions of 
evaulations, a dict has (loosely speaking) O(1) search which should be much faster than the function evaluation

The Second speedup is making sure that run specific elements are re-used as efficiently as possible. If we let each 
run occupy it's own thread we can let them share these local elements, which again saves unnessecary recalculation,
examples of where we can do this is for instance P(t,T,rt) which does depend on an observed interest rate, but will
likely occur multiple times, or the ZCB values which are time step dependant but called by many Swaptions.

Finally the last speedup is to use multithreading to wrap the above. With all of these in play it should be possible
to efficiently generate our paths
